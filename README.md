# HoriSEOn

## Webpage Code Refactor
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the HoriSEOn homepage refactor; 
otherwise known as Homework 1 for the UT Coding Bootcamp (PT) 07/2020.

For this assignment, students were given sample code with a User Story and 
Acceptance Criteria relating to a folder containting:
1) an idex.html file;
2) a CSS folder (with a style.css);
3) an images folder (with various images used on the website).

Students were expected to replace <div> elements with HTML5 semantic elements; 
update attributes (class/id structure; add alt attributes to <img> elements); add a title 
to the <head> element (famicon optional); amongst other things.

The HoriSEOn repository represents my efforts at completing the assignment in a 
satisfactory manner.

### Credits

While the bulk of the worked presented in the HoriSEOn repository was my own, there are always 
countless behind the scenes who helped make this a reality.  Credit goes to the UT Coding Bootcamp 
faculty and staff for developing the code; Instructors, TAs, and Tutors for their help and guidance;
and all the little people (because they never get enough credit!).

#### License

To my knowledge this code has no license and needs none.
